Programming Assignment 4: The Waiting Game

Imagine that the student services center (SSC), which houses the registrar, cashier, and financial aid office, has approached you with the following issues. At certain times during the day, students arrive in large numbers, each needing to visit one or more offices. If there are not enough windows open at each, the average student wait times are too long, and they receive many complaints. On the other hand, if they open too many windows, their staff will be idle for most of the time, and they will be wasting money. They want you to program a simulation that will allow them to calculate metrics on student wait times and window idle times given a specific traffic flow of students through the SSC.

CUSTOMER

  A customer has two different queues with times and offices to enter, as well as a time the student enters the first office. After each office, each queue has one value removed.

OFFICE

  This office contains a number of windows, each able to serve a customer. The customer is served for however long they need the window for. When they're finished, they move to the next office. If a window is still in service, we wait. When students arrive at the same time and visit the same office first, the first student listed is the first to get into line. If 2 students finish at different offices at the same time and head to the same office next, they enter the line based on alphabetical order of the office they are coming from.

SERVICE CENTER

  The Service Center holds on to the customers who are waiting for their time. Every time the clock ticks, the students are moved to their offices. The program is constantly checking if all offices are finished.

WINDOW

  A window serves a customer and returns it when he/she is finished. It also keeps track of how long it's gone without serving a customer or how long it has left with a customer.

FILE PROCESSOR

  This program reads the input file and creates a Service Center to hold all customers.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile by typing "g++ -o test *.cpp".
2. Run code with "./test input.txt".
