Programming Assignment 4: The Waiting Game

Imagine that the student services center (SSC), which houses the registrar, cashier, and financial aid office, has approached you with the following issues. At certain times during the day, students arrive in large numbers, each needing to visit one or more offices. If there are not enough windows open at each, the average student wait times are too long, and they receive many complaints. On the other hand, if they open too many windows, their staff will be idle for most of the time, and they will be wasting money. They want you to program a simulation that will allow them to calculate metrics on student wait times and window idle times given a specific traffic flow of students through the SSC.
